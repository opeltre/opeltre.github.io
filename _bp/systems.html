<h1> Statistical Systems </h1> 

<p> 
Consider a large collection $\Omega = \{i, j, k, \dots \}$ 
of individual variables, each of them 
denoted by $x_i \in E_i$ and assumed 
to take values in a finite configuration space $E_i$.

<p>
In physics, one would for instance describe by
the cubic lattice $\Omega = {\mathbb Z}^3$ the atoms of a regular crystal, 
each of which carrying a spin $x_i$ in $E_i = \{ \pm 1 \}$ 
in the Ising model of ferromagnetism. 
Spin glasses drop the symmetry assumption:
$\Omega$ then describes the atoms of an amorphous solid, 
where pairwise magnetic couplings are randomly distributed. 
</p>

<p> 
In communications, a sequence $x_i \in \{ 0, 1 \}$ 
describes a binary encoded message transmitted 
over a noisy communication channel. 
Decoding will consist in reconstructing the original message 
from the altered version received. 
</p> 

<p> 
In neural networks, 
a binary variable $x_i$ would describe  
two states "not firing" and "firing at maximal rate" 
of an individual neuron, 
as in the Hopfield model of associative memory.
Intermediate firing rates may be viewed as
convex combinations of such extremal rates,
i.e. probability densities on $E_i$.
</p> 

<p>
When $\Omega$ grows large, applications face with the challenge of 
describing interactions and collective phenomena effectively, 
as the cost of global computations
is exponential in the number of variables. 
</p> 

<h2> Sheaf of Microscopic States </h2> 

<p>
A global configuration of the system  
$x_\Omega = (x_i)_{i \in \Omega}$ gives the state 
of everyone simultaneously, i.e. it is a point of the cartesian product:
</p> 

$$ E_\Omega = \prod_{i \in \Omega} E_i $$ 

<p> 
A local configuration of $\alpha \subseteq \Omega$ 
determines only the state 
$x_\alpha = (x_i)_{i \in \alpha}$ 
of variables inside $\alpha$, and we write:
</p>
$$E_\alpha = \prod_{i \in \alpha} E_i$$ 

<p>
Given $\alpha \supseteq \beta$,
a local configuration $x_\alpha \in E_\alpha$
induces a unique configuration $x_\beta \in E_\beta$,
forgetting the states of variables outside $\beta$. 
The canonical restrictions $E_\alpha \to E_\beta$  
give $E_{\bullet}$ the structure of a discrete sheaf of sets 
over $\Omega$: 
</p>

<p> 
Each $E_i$ is called the <em>fiber</em> above $i \in \Omega$, 
and $x_\alpha \in E_\alpha$ is called a <em>local section</em>
of $E_\bullet$ over $\alpha \subseteq \Omega$. 
</p>

<h2> Total Energy and Homology </h2> 

<p> 
The total hamiltonian $H_\Omega(x_\Omega)$ describes the energy 
of the system in each configuration. 
It is an element of the algebra of global observables: 
</p> 
$$ 
A_\Omega = {\mathbb R}^{E_\Omega} 
\simeq \bigotimes_{i \in \Omega} {\mathbb R}^{E_i}
$$
<p> 
The dimension of $A_\Omega$ 
is exponential in the cardinal of $\Omega$,
although in practice $H_\Omega$ is parametrised by a much 
smaller subspace of $A_\Omega$ and may be written as a sum of 
local interactions: 
</p>
$$ \begin{equation} \label{H_Omega} 
H_\Omega(x_\Omega) = \sum_{\alpha \in X } h_{\alpha}(x_\alpha) 
\end{equation}$$ 
<p>
whenever the covering $X \subseteq {\mathcal P}(\Omega)$ 
is coarse enough to yield all the non-zero
interaction potentials. 
The Ising model for instance assumes 
only pairwise magnetic interactions between nearest neighbours, 
its hamiltonian decomposing as:
</p> 
$$ 
H_\Omega(x_\Omega) = - \sum_{i} B_i \, x_i 
- \sum_{ij} C_{ij}\, x_i x_j 
$$
<p> 
so that $H_\Omega$ is parametrised by interaction potentials of the form:
</p> 
<ul>
<li> $h_i(x_i) = \pm B_i$ depending on whether $x_i$ is aligned with 
the local magnetic field $B_i$, 
</li> 
<li> $h_{ij}(x_i, x_j) = \pm C_{ij}$ depending on whether $x_i$ and $x_j$ 
are aligned or not. 
</li> 
</ul> 
<p> 
It is common for the covering $X$ 
to form a graph in $\Omega$, having 
edges of cardinal 2 as maximal elements,
although in general nothing prevents $X$ from having higher dimensional cells
$\alpha \subseteq \Omega$, such as triangles, tetrahedrons, etc. 
</p> 

<p> 
A <em>factor graph</em> represents $X \subseteq {\mathcal P}(\Omega)$ 
by a bipartite graph with  
a variable node for each $i \in \Omega$,
a factor node for each $\alpha \in X$,
and an edge between $\alpha$ and $i$ whenever $i \in \alpha$,
as depicted below.

<strong>Definition.</strong> 
Given $X \subseteq {\mathcal P}(\Omega)$, we call 
<em>potential</em> a collection of local observables 
$(h_\alpha)_{\alpha \in X}$ where $h_\alpha \in {\mathbb R}^{E_\alpha}$ 
for all $\alpha \in X$, and denote by: 
</p> 
$$ 
A_0(X) = \bigoplus_{\alpha \in X} A_\alpha
\quad \mathrm{with} \quad 
A_\alpha = {\mathbb R}^{E_\alpha} 
$$ 
<p>
or simply by $A_0$ when unambiguous, 
the space of potentials over $X$.

<div class="definition">
    <p> <strong> Definition.</strong>
For every $h \in A_0(X)$, we denote by:
</p> 
$$
\int_X h : x_\Omega \mapsto \sum_{\alpha \in X} h_\alpha(x_\alpha) 
$$ 
<p> 
the global observable of $A_\Omega$ defined by summing 
contributions of all the potentials $h_\alpha$,
as in $(\ref{H_Omega})$.
