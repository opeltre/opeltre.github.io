- __PhD thesis__: [Message Passing Algorithms and Homology][phd]

- __SYCO'20__: [Homological Algebra for Message Passing Algorithms][syco]

    This is a short, 5 page-long resume I wrote for the SYCO conference, 
    which should have taken place at the end of march.
    Although dense, it may give a quick overview of 
    most of the results contained in the thesis. 
    It was intended for an audience familiar with homological algebra and 
    category theory.

- __GSI'19__:
[A Homological Approach to Belief Propagation and Belief Propagation][gsi]
    
    This is a first proof of the equivalence between critical points 
    of Bethe free energies and stationary states of message passing algorithms, 
    which I presented at the _Geometric Science of Information_ colloquium, 
    held in Toulouse last summer. (Published in the __GSI 19__ proceedings.)
