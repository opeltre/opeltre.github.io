# About me 

I hope to be soon defending my PhD thesis: 
[Message Passing Algorithms and Homology][phd].

This work brought me to explore the rich interface between physics,
computer science and mathematics,
which are some of the topics you may hear about on this website.

I am also a contributor of [geomstats], 
an open-source python library for Riemannian geometry in machine learning
built by a fantastic team of international collaborators.
