# About me

My PhD thesis is available here: 
[Message Passing Algorithms and Homology][phd], 
and on the [arXiv][arxiv-phd].

This work brought me to explore a rich interface between physics,
computer science and mathematics.

I was also a contributor of [geomstats], 
an open-source python library for Riemannian geometry in machine learning
built by a fantastic team of international collaborators.
